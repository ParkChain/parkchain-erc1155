# ERC1155:
   
ERC-1155 allows for the creation of both fungible (identical and interchangeable) and non-fungible (unique) tokens within the same contract.

This flexibility makes it suitable for various applications, including gaming, digital collectibles, and decentralized finance (DeFi).

ERC-1155 supports batch transfers, enabling users to send multiple tokens of different types in a single transaction. 
      
ERC-1155 tokens are compatible with other token standards such as ERC-20 and ERC-721. This composability allows for interoperability between different applications and ecosystems.
      
Each token in an ERC-1155 contract can have its own metadata, including name, symbol, and other optional information.
This metadata can be used for displaying information about the tokens in user interfaces.

ERC-1155 has gained popularity in the gaming industry as it offers a more efficient and flexible way to manage in-game assets. 
It has also found utility in other domains, such as digital art, tokenized real-world assets, and DeFi applications.
